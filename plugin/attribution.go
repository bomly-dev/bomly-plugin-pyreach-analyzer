// rootAttribution is how firmly a dependency node's declaration sites tie it
// to the module root currently being analyzed.
//
// ADR-0037 makes the module root the mandatory attribution floor for
// reachability evidence and node references the optional ceiling — refs exist
// for "analyzers that can attribute to a specific occurrence", and a consumer
// must read their absence as "not stated", never as "no occurrence". Naming
// whichever node the annotation loop happens to be visiting states a precision
// the analysis does not have: it pins an occurrence to a root nothing tied it
// to, which is a false claim rather than a vague one.
//
// This rule reads SDK types to produce SDK types and its proper home is the
// SDK, next to ReachabilityEvidence; it lives here in four copies only because
// the analyzers are four modules with no shared internal package. Tracked as
// https://github.com/bomly-dev/bomly-sdk/issues/68.
//
// This analyzer never uses attributedToSite to name a node reference, only to
// decide the root filter. See the comment on applyRunnerResult: pyreach's seed
// set is keyed by canonical distribution name, so it cannot separate two
// occurrences of one distribution even when the graph holds them.

// roots are the same vocabulary. Detectors record the root they resolved
// from; this analyzer derives roots from the filesystem. When those two
// disagree — a relative workspace path against an absolute module directory,
// say — a non-match means the two are speaking past each other, not that the
// package is absent, and dropping the node's evidence on that basis would lose
